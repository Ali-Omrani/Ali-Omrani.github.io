It includes hierarchical labels for dehumanizing and violent speech, targeted groups, and rhetorical framing.

      "2021-08-03\tImproving counterfactual generation for fair hate speech detection\tACL 2021\tBias mitigation approaches reduce models' dependence on sensitive features of data, such as social group tokens (SGTs), resulting in equal predictions across the sensitive features. In hate speech detection, however, equalizing model predictions may ignore important differences among targeted social groups, as hate speech can contain stereotypical language specific to each SGT. Here, to take the specific language about each SGT into account, we rely on counterfactual fairness and equalize predictions among counterfactuals, generated by changing the SGTs. Our method evaluates the similarity in sentence likelihoods (via pre-trained language models) among counterfactuals, to treat SGTs equally only within interchangeable contexts. By applying logit pairing to equalize outcomes on the restricted set of counterfactuals for each instance, we improve fairness metrics while preserving model performance on hate speech detection.\tDavani, Aida Mostafazadeh, et al. \"Proceedings of the 5th Workshop on Online Abuse and Harms (WOAH 2021).\" Proceedings of the 5th Workshop on Online Abuse and Harms (WOAH 2021). 2021.\tpaper-title-number-3\thttps://aclanthology.org/2021.woah-1.10/\r",

      "2023-07-01\tSocial-Group-Agnostic Bias Mitigation via the Stereotype Content Model\tACL 2023\tExisting methods typically rely on word pairs specific to certain social groups, limiting their effectiveness to one aspect of social identity. This approach becomes impractical and costly when addressing bias in lesser-known or unmarked social groups. Instead, we proposed leveraging the Stereotype Content Model (SCM), a framework from social psychology. The SCM categorizes stereotypes along two dimensions: warmth and competence. By adopting this social-group-agnostic perspective, we demonstrated comparable performance to group-specific debiasing methods while offering theoretical and practical advantages over existing techniques.\tAli Omrani, Alireza Salkhordeh Ziabari, Charles Yu, Preni Golazizian, Brendan Kennedy, Mohammad Atari, Heng Ji, and Morteza Dehghani. 2023.
